                <h2><strong>ROM</strong></h2>
                <p class="main-text">ROM (Read-only Memory), also known as firmware, is a storage medium that contains permanent non-volatile data. Read-only Memory contains the programming information that lets a computing device regenerate or startup whenever the switch is on. This is also the part of a computer that executes massive input/output (I/O) tasks and safeguards software instructions or programs. There can be no removal of the data stored on a ROM chip.
                    Most computers integrate a tiny amount of ROM that hosts the startup firmware. BIOS (basic input/output system) is another terminology for the boot firmware. A set of codes makes up this software that directs the computer boot-up processes. This includes carrying out hardware diagnostics and loading OS (Operating System) into the RAM (Random Access Memory). As a result of this, ROM is frequently used when updating firmware.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Custom ROM</strong></h2>
                <p class="main-text">Custom ROM is a uniquely modified operating system developed and built by a third party vendor which is available for older or newer devices before the manufacturer update release. A custom ROM offers more refined and customized user controls and flexibility than the Stock ROM because the device is completely unlocked so that users can customize their device to their taste. A custom ROM replaces your device’s original Android operating system with a new version of the Android operating system. However, replacing the stock ROM with a custom ROM may void the warranty of the device. Custom ROMs are developed mostly by a community of core developers who do some modifications to the original firmware that is based on the Android source code and release the new version of the firmware with improved functionalities and more customization options. A custom ROM is like the same body as a stock ROM but with a different soul.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Difference between Stock ROM and Custom ROM</strong></h2>
                    <h3>Firmware</h3>
                        <p class="main-text">– ROM is nothing but the operating system of the mobile device. Stock ROM is the default ROM – that is, the operating system – provided by the device manufacturer. Stock ROM is the official firmware of the device manufacturer that goes through rigorous testing and scheduled release cycles. A custom ROM, on the other hand, is an unofficial firmware for a specific device developed by some independent developers who did some modifications to the source code and release it to the general public. Custom ROM is a uniquely modified firmware developed and built by a third party vendor.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Stability</h3>
                        <p class="main-text">– Stock ROM is the original and the official software designed by the device manufacturer for that particular device and which goes through rigorous testing and scheduled release cycles to ensure the stability of the operating system. Custom ROMs, on the other hand, can be notoriously unstable because they are being developed and tested independently at a much faster pace, and the unscheduled release cycles mean there is no assurance on the stability of the OS.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                        <p class="main-text">– Although, the official firmware, which is the stock ROM, is more stable than a custom ROM, no overclocking is allowed and users often get restrictions in the functionalities of the device based on region, carrier, etc. However, stock ROMs are designed to deliver optimal performance thanks to their stable environment. Custom ROMs, on the other hand, allow for extensive customizations and all kinds of performance enhancements, such as battery performance, new themes, new UI, and more.</p>
